    PlaylistItem:
      description: >-
        A *playlistItem* resource identifies another resource, such as a video,
        that is included in a playlist. In addition, the playlistItem resource
        contains details about the included resource that pertain specifically
        to how that resource is used in that playlist. YouTube uses playlists to
        identify special collections of videos for a channel, such as: -
        uploaded videos - favorite videos - positively rated (liked) videos -
        watch history - watch later To be more specific, these lists are
        associated with a channel, which is a collection of a person, group, or
        company's videos, playlists, and other YouTube information. You can
        retrieve the playlist IDs for each of these lists from the channel
        resource for a given channel. You can then use the playlistItems.list
        method to retrieve any of those lists. You can also add or remove items
        from those lists by calling the playlistItems.insert and
        playlistItems.delete methods. For example, if a user gives a positive
        rating to a video, you would insert that video into the liked videos
        playlist for that user's channel.

          description: >-
            Indicates whether the stream is reusable, which means that it can be
            bound to multiple broadcasts. It is common for broadcasters to reuse
            the same stream for many different broadcasts if those broadcasts
            occur at different times. If you set this value to false, then the
            stream will not be reusable, which means that it can only be bound
            to one broadcast. Non-reusable streams differ from reusable streams
            in the following ways: - A non-reusable stream can only be bound to
            one broadcast. - A non-reusable stream might be deleted by an
            automated process after the broadcast ends. - The liveStreams.list
            method does not list non-reusable streams if you call the method and
            set the mine parameter to true. The only way to use that method to
            retrieve the resource for a non-reusable stream is to use the id
            parameter to identify the stream.

        A *playlist* resource represents a YouTube playlist. A playlist is a
        collection of videos that can be viewed sequentially and shared with
        other users. A playlist can contain up to 200 videos, and YouTube does
        not limit the number of playlists that each user creates. By default,
        playlists are publicly visible to other users, but playlists can be
        public or private. YouTube also uses playlists to identify special
        collections of videos for a channel, such as: - uploaded videos -
        favorite videos - positively rated (liked) videos - watch history -
        watch later To be more specific, these lists are associated with a
        channel, which is a collection of a person, group, or company's videos,
        playlists, and other YouTube information. You can retrieve the playlist
        IDs for each of these lists from the channel resource for a given
        channel. You can then use the playlistItems.list method to retrieve any
        of those lists. You can also add or remove items from those lists by
        calling the playlistItems.insert and playlistItems.delete methods.
